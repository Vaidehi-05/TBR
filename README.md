>Ever found yourself wanting to read, but clueless where to start? Or just really wishing for a fairy Godmother to appear and hand you the next book you'll fall in love with? Here we present, a **_book recommendation platform_** that takes you through a tour of the reading world, and helps you choose, such that by the time you reach the end of the journey, our platform presents you with your own To Be Read list tailored completely to your own preferences! 🎉

### About📝⭐<br>
A reading journey is but a chaotic one. Every single book, from your first pick at the start, to your next one plays a pivotal role in making it the most wholesome love you can return to again and again. **_TBR_** makes this chaotic process a flawless one by analysing your taste and preferences through our extensive questionnaire. Implemented completely using **C**, it's a rather amateur project by a reader-coder, a beginning tribute to the two hobbies destined to design her life :)) 🌻

### Features 📖✨<br>
✔️ Throws a cool fun fact at start of each run for all those booktroverts!<br>
✔️ In depth questionairre, analysing your reading taste on a variety of parameters such as: current book lover level, genre, author, subgenres based on selected genres and many more.<br>
✔️ Further detailed evaluation based on your current book experiences.<br>
✔️ A simple command line based UI for easy interaction.<br>
